# -INTEGER-PROGRAMMING-TO-CREATE-NURSE-SCHEDULES-THAT-MINIMIZES-OVERTIME-
Hospitals must assign nurses across multiple shifts spanning seven days while accommodating variable patient demand and staffing constraints

Mathematical optimization ensures whole-number assignments—you can't schedule half a nurse—while automatically handling complex rules

Hospitals must create nurse schedules that:
Meet patient–nurse ratios per unit and shift.
Minimize overtime and operational costs.
Respect nurse qualifications, rest rules, fairness, and maximum working hours.
Handle uncertain patient demand, which fluctuates daily or even intra-day.
Traditional deterministic scheduling models assume fixed demand, which leads to:
Over-staffing (wasted cost) in low-demand periods.
Under-staffing and excess overtime during peaks.
Poor resilience when demand deviates from forecasts.

Thus, the challenge is to build a scheduling method that explicitly incorporates uncertainty, while producing feasible, practical rosters that reduce overtime and maintain service quality.
